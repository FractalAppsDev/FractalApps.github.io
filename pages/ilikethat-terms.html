                        <p>This page ("Terms", "Agreement") informs you about terms of service and of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        
                        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. 
                        By using the App, the Service and/or maintaining the relationship with the Company, you (the Shop Owner) agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. 
                        By using the App, the Service and/or maintaining the relationship with the Company, you (the Shop Owner) also agree with any terms and conditions stated within this Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

                        <h2>Application of discounts</h2>
                        <p>
                            The App automatically applies discounts on products based on configuration of the App. The discount values are calculated proportionally for each product and the total discount value may differ because the discounted price of each product has to be rounded.
                            The Shop Owner should check and validate application of any discounts before accepting the user's order. In case the App fails to apply the specified discounts, the Shop Owner should decide whether to accept or reject the specific order.
                            The Company takes no responsibility or liability for wrong application of any discounts or any potential loss of revenue.
                        </p>

                                <li>The consent for the usage of the data should be gathered by Shopify or by the Shop Owner. The controller (the Shop Owner) should only instruct the processing of data which one has consent for.
                                    The Company is not responsible for any unlawful usage of personal data. The Shop Owner is responsible for all usage of personal information and other data within the App and the Service.
